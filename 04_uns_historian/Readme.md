[![MQTT Client for Historian](https://github.com/mkashwin/unifiednamespace/actions/workflows/uns_historian-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mkashwin/unifiednamespace/actions/workflows/uns_historian-app.yml)

# Application to store messages to Historian 
It makes sense to have the historian connect only to the corporate / cloud instance since the factory doesn't necessarily need the history of all messages. The historian should  subscribe to '**#**' or the first level **\<enterprise\>/#**' topic wildcard. However if it is needed for your specific scenario you can easily deploy a historian at the factory level.
If you need to scale and reduce the load on broker multiple instanced of this client can be deployed with separate topic wild cards
> Ensure that each instance is subscribing to it's unique topic and not causing any overlaps

## Deploying and running TimescaleDB
There are a number of ways to deploy and run your TimescaleDB instance locally. 
I chose to run this as a docker instance to ease the setup and portability. 

**[Detail Guide](https://docs.timescale.com/install/latest/installation-docker/#install-self-hosted-timescaledb-from-a-pre-built-container)**

>**Important Note:** Remember to update the passwords being passed to the docker run command for the postgres user (i.e. `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<postgres user pwd>`)
Quick command reference 
```bash
# install docker
sudo snap install docker
# add current user to docker group so that we don't need to sudo for docker executions 
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# you might need to reboot here  
# install the postgres client 
sudo apt install postgresql-client-common postgresql-client-12 postgresql-doc-12

# install & run postgres db 
docker run \
    --name uns_timescaledb  \
    -p 5432:5432  \
    -v $HOME/timescaledb/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -d \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=uns_historian \
    timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg14
# =--name : name given to your container
# -p : provide ports of operation 
# -v : volume to persist data 
#- d : run the container detached
#-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=uns_historian \ #<super user password>. REMEMBER to update the password

# Create the db and enable the timescaledb extension
psql -U postgres -h localhost -f './sql_scripts/01_setup_db.sql'

#create DBA
docker exec -ti uns_timescaledb bash -c "su postgres -c 'createuser --createdb --createrole --login -e uns_dba -P'" 
# Manually enter the password for the dba

#create application user (to be used in the configuration by the application)
docker exec -ti uns_timescaledb bash -c "su postgres -c 'createuser --login -e uns_dbuser -P'"
#Manually enter the password for application user

# create the hypertable with the application user 
psql -U uns_dbuser  -h localhost -d uns_historian -f './sql_scripts/02_setup_hypertable.sql'

```
**The key parameters you must update for your environment are :**
* \<postgres password\> : password for the super user which is passed to the docker command  `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=`
* \<dba password\> : password for the DBA will be needed for db mgmt. activities
* \<application user password\> : is the password needed to connect to the DB. Needs to also be updated in [./.secrets.yaml](#key-configurations-to-provide) 

Depending on your context you may need to change the other properties like container name, port, directories etc. 
Once the docker container is deployed you can start / stop it by the commands
```bash
docker start  uns_timescaledb #<container_name>
docker stop  uns_timescaledb #<container_name>
```

## Running the python script
This function is executed by the following command with the current folder as `04_uns_historian`
```bash
# install virtual env
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
python -m venv env_historian
source env_historian/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install  -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade -e .
pip install --upgrade -e ../02_mqtt-cluster
python ./src/uns_historian/uns_mqtt_historian.py
```

### Running tests
The set of test for this module is executed by
```python
source env_historian/bin/activate
python -m pip install  -r requirements_dev.txt
#run all tests excluding integration tests 
pytest -m "not integrationtest" test/
# runs all tests
pytest test/
```


## The Logic for persisting the message into the historian
The historian will be persisting all the MQTT messages in the raw format directly after extracting the timestamp from the message
The message format is expected to be in JSON and should have an attribute `timestamp`
The attribute key name is configurable in [settings.yaml](./settings.yaml)
If this attribute is missing the application will use the current time 
```python
time.time()
```


## Limitations 
1. Need to check how to containerize and perhaps deploy this on the same cluster as the MQTT  brokers
1. Add and improve automated test coverage
